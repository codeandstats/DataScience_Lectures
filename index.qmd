# Preface {.unnumbered}

Data Science course taught by Professor Markus Loecher (HWR Berlin). 

## About this course

Welcome to most important course youâ€™ll ever take: **Data Science** ðŸ™„
Here is my overview of the structure and contents of this unique blend
of stats/coding/machine learning: The first few weeks will focus on
<i>statistical thinking</i>, and I will lean heavily on the book
<a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/" target="_blank">Think
Stats</a> (as well as the DataCamp
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1"
        target="_blank">Statistical Thinking in Python</a>). From week 4
on, we will shift attention to basic concepts from machine learning and
rely more on the
<a href="https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/" target="_blank">ISLR
book</a> and the
<a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supervised-learning-with-scikit-learn"
        target="_blank">sklearn</a> library. If time permits, I am
planning to cover the
<a href="http://makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">basics
of neural networks</a>.

## Course components

All lecture materials can be found on this
<a href="https://github.com/markusloecher/DataScience2021/" target="_blank">github
page</a> .


There will be a weekly homework assignment which is not graded. I
strongly recommend you to give your very best shot. I will provide
solutions and if you upload your homework, I will try to look over
it.<br></span>

## Grading

There will be a final exam at the end of the semester which counts
**70%** towards your grade. Due to the Corona uncertainties, I cannot
specify yet whether it will be taken online or at HWR. The remaining
**30%** of the total points are earned via the final project, which will
be tackled in groups of 4-5 and is typically a
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle </a>competition or a similar
data analysis task. The deliveries are a report and a final
presentation. We will start on this project in the middle of the
semester.


DataCamp
------
[DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/) is a pretty good resource for students to learn coding and data analysis skills.
By completing the DataCamp courses listed below we would be able to significantly shorten 
the time we spend on basics and open up more space for data science concepts.

* [Introduction to Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
* [Intermediate Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-python)

If you have extra time:
* [Data Manipulation with pandas](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas)

And much more advanced and totally optional:

* [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1)
* [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2)
* [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1)
* [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2)

Coding Environment
------
The most convenient environment for you to code in might be [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), for which you probably need a gmail account. It does not hurt to look at the 2-minute intro video.
If you prefer a real IDE, I would recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/). (I will not be able to help much with the latter though)
